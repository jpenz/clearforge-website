# ClearForge Brand Identity V5

## Brand Purpose
ClearForge exists to give mid-market companies ($5M+) and PE portfolio companies the same AI transformation capabilities that Fortune 500s get from elite consulting firms — but with actual implementation, not just decks.

## Brand Values
1. **Results Over Activity** — We measure success by business outcomes, not hours billed or slides delivered.
2. **Radical Transparency** — Transparent pricing, clear deliverables, honest assessments. If AI isn't right for you, we'll say so.
3. **Craftsmanship** — Senior operators only. The people in the discovery call do the work. We build what we recommend.

## Brand Personality
ClearForge is the senior partner at a top consulting firm who also happens to be an engineer. They walk into a boardroom in a well-tailored navy suit, listen carefully, ask incisive questions, then roll up their sleeves and build the solution themselves. Serious but not stuffy. Confident but not arrogant. Direct, data-driven, and allergic to buzzwords. They don't need to prove they're smart — their results speak.

- Serious (not playful)
- Formal-leaning (not casual)
- Confident (not reserved)
- Modern (not traditional)
- Understated (not bold/flashy)

## Target Audience
CEOs/COOs of $5M-$500M companies, PE operating partners, VP of Operations. People who wear sport coats, not hoodies. They value trust, credibility, results, and efficiency. They're skeptical of hype and allergic to startup theatrics.

**Authoritative:** Speak with confidence earned through results.
- DO: "Most AI pilots fail because they start with technology, not business problems."

**Substantive:** Every sentence carries weight. No filler.

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette — "Boardroom Premium"

**Light mode default.** Premium, editorial, breaks from dark-mode AI cliché.

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Midnight** | `#0F1A2E` | Primary dark — headings, hero backgrounds, nav |
| **Charcoal** | `#1C2B3A` | Secondary dark — card backgrounds on dark sections |
| **Slate** | `#4A5568` | Body text on light backgrounds |
| **Stone** | `#718096` | Secondary text, captions |
| **Fog** | `#E2E8F0` | Borders, dividers |
| **Ivory** | `#F7F8FA` | Section alternating backgrounds |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary background |
| **Brass** | `#B8860B` | Primary accent — CTAs, metrics, highlights |
| **Gold** | `#D4A84B` | Accent hover state |
| **Forest** | `#1B5E3B` | Success states, positive indicators |

**Rationale:** Deep navy (trust, authority — think KKR, Blackstone). Warm brass accent (premium, established — think law firm letterhead). Light backgrounds (editorial, readable, premium — think The Economist). No purple, no gradients, no neon.

### Typography

**Heading:** `Libre Bodoni` — High-contrast modern serif. Editorial elegance. Says "established firm, not startup."
**Body:** `Plus Jakarta Sans` — Clean, modern, highly readable. Geometric without being cold.
**Mono (metrics):** `JetBrains Mono` — Technical credibility for numbers and data.

**Size Scale:**
- Display: 72px / 4.5rem (desktop) → 40px (mobile)
- H1: 56px / 3.5rem → 32px
- H2: 40px / 2.5rem → 28px
- H3: 28px / 1.75rem → 22px
- Body: 17px / 1.0625rem
- Small: 14px / 0.875rem
- Caption: 12px / 0.75rem

### Design Tone
**Editorial/Magazine** with **Luxury/Refined** elements.

The unforgettable element: **Typography and whitespace.** Not animations. Not gradients. The site should feel like reading a beautifully typeset annual report from a firm that manages billions.

### Imagery Style
- No stock photos
- Data-driven — metrics, charts, numbers are the visual interest
- Clean geometric dividers
- Generous whitespace as a design element
- Subtle paper-like warmth to backgrounds

### Logo
Wordmark: "ClearForge" in Libre Bodoni. The period after ".ai" in brass.

## Brand Decision Filter
Before publishing anything, ask:
- Does this look like it belongs on the website of a $500M PE firm? (Not a YC startup)
- Does this sound like a senior partner speaking? (Not a marketing intern)
- Does this visually match our palette — navy, white, brass? (Not purple, not dark mode)
- Is every word earning its place? (No filler, no fluff)

# ClearForge.ai V3 Zero-Based Redesign Brief

## Vision
Best-in-class AI consulting website. Must look like it was built by a $500K agency. Competing with Bain.com, McKinsey.com, Deloitte.com — but sharper, more modern, and unapologetically tech-forward.

## Brand Identity (Locked from V2 — Refined)
- **Tagline**: "Strategy that ships. AI that performs."
- **Positioning**: Both strategy + implementation (not one or the other)
- **Target**: $5M+ companies, owners/operators/PE firms, national
- **Palette**: Forge Navy #0B1D33, Molten Amber #C8963E, warm white #F5F3EF, Deep Steel #1A3A5C, Signal Blue #0074D9
- **Typography**: DM Serif Display (headlines) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (metrics)
- **Design**: Sharp corners (0px radius), no shadows, flat design, light mode default
- **Tone**: Direct, confident, no fluff. Like a sharp partner at a top-tier firm who also builds.

## Differentiators to Showcase
1. Strategy + Implementation = one team, one engagement (not handoff to another firm)
2. AI agents that continuously optimize (not one-time projects)
3. Transparent pricing (3 productized packages)
4. Real results with real metrics
5. Built by ex-Bain consultants who actually write code

## Pages & Sections
1. **Hero** — Bold statement, animated metrics/counters, immediate credibility
2. **What We Do** — 3 service tiers with clear deliverables
3. **How We Work** — Process visualization (Discover → Design → Deploy → Optimize)
4. **Case Study: Industrial Manufacturer** — Anonymized Samuel story:
   - Client: $2B+ industrial manufacturer, 70+ facilities, 16 business divisions
   - Challenge: Sales team targeting wrong prospects, no market intelligence
   - Solution: AI-powered sales intelligence platform + monthly strategic market reports
   - Built n8n workflow automation for state-by-state prospect research
   - AI agents research prospects, enrich contacts, score opportunities
   - Monthly "refresh reports" — market trends, competitive shifts, new segments
   - Continuous optimization: agents retrained monthly on what's converting
   - Results: 192 qualified targets identified in first sweep, 5 new market segments discovered, 60% reduction in prospecting time
5. **AI Readiness Scorecard** — Interactive 18-question assessment (soft-gated lead capture)
6. **Pricing** — 3 packages: AI Readiness Audit ($15K), Performance Sprint ($50-100K), AI Agent Retainer ($15K/mo)
7. **About / Team** — Principals background (anonymized — no firm names)
8. **White Paper Section** — "The Continuous AI Agent" — how AI agents that learn and adapt beat one-time implementations
9. **Testimonials / Social Proof** — Client quotes, metrics, logos (anonymized)
10. **Contact / CTA** — Multiple conversion points throughout
11. **Blog/Insights** (placeholder structure)
12. **Footer** — Full navigation, newsletter signup

## Case Study Detail: The Continuous Optimization Story
This is the KEY differentiator to highlight. Most AI consultancies build something and leave.
ClearForge builds AI agents that:
- Run monthly market intelligence sweeps
- Auto-update targeting based on market shifts (BEAD program, infrastructure spending, etc.)
- Enrich and score new leads continuously
- Generate Bain/McKinsey-quality market reports on demand
- Adapt to new product lines and geographies
- Feed into CRM/sales workflows automatically

The Samuel engagement is the proof point (anonymized as "Fortune 1000 Industrial Manufacturer"):
- 82-page market study covering 16 divisions
- 358 companies identified across 10 roll-up industries  
- AI sales intelligence deployed across Pressure Vessel + Automation divisions
- Geographic expansion recommendations data-driven, not gut feel

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Framer Motion for animations
- Mobile-first responsive
- Vercel deployment ready
- SEO optimized (meta tags, OG images, structured data)
- Performance: Lighthouse 95+ on all metrics
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)
- No generic AI imagery (robots, neural networks, glowing brains)
- No garish colors (no bright red, pink, yellow)
- No rounded corners or soft shadows
- No "We leverage cutting-edge AI" generic copy
- No stock photos of people in suits
- Don't mention Bain, McKinsey, or any specific firm by name
- Don't name Samuel or any client
